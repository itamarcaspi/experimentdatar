[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/itamarcaspi/experimentdatar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/itamarcaspi/experimentdatar)
[![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/itamarcaspi/experimentdatar?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/itamarcaspi/experimentdatar)

The `experimentdatar` data package contains publicly available datasets that were used in Susan Athey and Guido Imbens' course ["Machine Learning and Econometrics"](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/cont-ed/2018-webcasts) (AEA continuing Education, 2018). The datasets are conveniently packed for R users.

## Installation

You can install the **development** version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/itamarcaspi/experimentdatar/)

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("itamarcaspi/experimentdatar")
```

## Usage

Load `experimentdatar` and other required libraries
```{r data, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(experimentdatar)
```

Load the `social` dataset and display the response and treatment variables

```{r}
data(social)  
social %>% 
  select(outcome_voted, treat_neighbors) %>% 
  head()
```

There is also a function `dataDetails` that opens the original paper where the data was used

```{r details, eval=FALSE}
dataDetails("social")
```
